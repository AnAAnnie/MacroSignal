# MacroSignal

**MacroSignal** is a machine learning-based framework for extracting and evaluating macroeconomic signals as alpha factors for U.S. equity selection.

## Project Highlights

- Use macroeconomic indicators (e.g., GDP growth, CPI, unemployment, interest rate spread, ISM) as **non-traditional alpha factors**
- Construct stock-level factor exposures based on macro data
- Evaluate predictive power using IC, IR, and long-short portfolio backtests
- Compare macro factors with traditional value/momentum factors
- Fully reproducible, modular, and academic-oriented
